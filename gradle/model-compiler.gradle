/*
 * This script configures Spine defaults for the Model Compiler code generation.
 *
 * Applies the following interfaces generation configurations:
 * — all messages in Protobuf files ending with "commands.proto" are marked as `CommandMessage`;
 * — all messages in Protobuf files ending with "events.proto" are marked as `EventMessage`;
 * — all messages in Protobuf files ending with "rejections.proto" are marked as `RejectionMessage`;
 * — all messages that qualify to be UUID messages are marked as `UuidValue`.
 *
 * And the following method generations are applied:
 * — all messages that qualify to be UUID messages have helper `generate` and `of` methods
 *   generated using `UuidMethodFactory`;
 * — all messages that have validating builders have helper `vBuilder` and instance `toVBuilder`
 *   methods generated using `VBuilderMethodFactory`.
 *
 * Be aware that the root project `buildscript` should already have a classpath
 * `io.spine.tools:spine-model-compiler:<version>` classpath dependency.
