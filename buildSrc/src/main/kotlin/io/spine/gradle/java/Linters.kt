/**
 * Disables Java linters in this [Project].
 *
 * In particular, the following linters will be disabled:
 *
 * 1. CheckStyle.
 * 2. PMD.
 * 3. ErrorProne.
 *
 * Apply this configuration for modules that have original Flogger sources,
 * which have not been migrated to Kotlin yet. They produce a lot of
 * errors/warnings failing the build.
 *
 * Our own sources are mostly in Kotlin (as for `spine-logging` repo),
 * so this action seems quite safe.
