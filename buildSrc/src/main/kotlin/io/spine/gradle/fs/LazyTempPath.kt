/**
 * A path to a temporary folder, which is not created until it is really used.
 *
 * After the first usage, the instances of this type delegate all calls to the internally
 * created instance of [Path] created with [createTempDirectory].
 *
 * The directory is created under the [shared base directory][SpineTempDir], which is removed
 * when the JVM — the Gradle daemon — shuts down. Build tasks delete their own directories
 * eagerly as the primary cleanup; this shutdown removal is a safety net, so a directory does
 * not outlive the daemon even when a build fails before its eager cleanup runs.
