/**
 * A per-JVM parent directory for the temporary directories created by the build.
 *
 * The directory is created [lazily][path] under a common, attributable namespace —
 * `<java.io.tmpdir>/io.spine.gradle.fs`, named after the package of [LazyTempPath] — so
 * that leftover files are easy to attribute. Within that namespace, each JVM gets its own
 * subdirectory named after the process id, so concurrent Gradle daemons never delete one
 * another's temporary files.
 *
 * Upon creation, the per-JVM directory is scheduled for recursive removal when the JVM
 * shuts down. This is a safety net should the explicit cleanup performed by the build
 * tasks not run — for example, when a build fails before reaching it. The shared namespace
 * directory itself is intentionally left in place: deleting it on shutdown could wipe
 * directories still in use by another JVM running on the same machine.
