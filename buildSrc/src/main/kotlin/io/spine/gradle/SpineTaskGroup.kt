/**
 * The Gradle task group used by every custom task registered or
 * configured by Spine SDK code.
 *
 * Setting `group = SpineTaskGroup.name` on every Spine-specific task
 * keeps them listed together under `spine` in `./gradlew tasks` and
 * in the IntelliJ IDEA Gradle tool window. See
 * `.agents/skills/gradle-review/spine-task-conventions.md` in the
 * `config` repository for the full convention and rationale.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * tasks.register("generateSpineModel") {
 *     group = SpineTaskGroup.name
 *     description = "Generates Spine model classes from .proto definitions"
 * }
 * ```
