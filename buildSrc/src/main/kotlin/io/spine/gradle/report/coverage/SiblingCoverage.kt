/**
 * Credits the test coverage produced by the [contributor] module for the classes
 * of this project to this project's own Kover report.
 *
 * Some modules' production classes are exercised only by the tests of a sibling
 * module — for example, the language-neutral `psi` classes are tested through
 * the Java-PSI fixtures that live in `psi-java`. Kover's per-module report sees
 * only this module's own test execution data, so that cross-module coverage is
 * otherwise missing from the per-module report (which is what Codecov consumes),
 * even though the root aggregated report already accounts for it.
 *
 * This function adds the [contributor]'s JaCoCo execution data to this project's
 * `total` report as additional binary reports. Only this project's classes are
 * credited from them — coverage of unrelated classes in the same execution data
 * is ignored, because a Kover report is scoped to the owning project's classes.
 * The report tasks are wired to run after the contributor's JVM test tasks so the
 * data is present when a report is generated.
 *
 * The contributor's JVM test tasks are discovered by type rather than by name, so
 * the helper works regardless of the module convention: a `jvm-module` contributes
 * through its `test` task, a `kmp-module` through `jvmTest`, and any additional
 * JVM test tasks are picked up as well. Non-JVM Kotlin test tasks (`*Native`,
 * `*Js`, …) are not of type [Test] and are correctly ignored — Kover instruments
 * only JVM test tasks.
 *
 * Requires the Kover plugin to be applied to this project.
 * A cross-project **task** dependency is used, not a project dependency,
 * so it does not introduce a dependency cycle even when the [contributor]
 * already depends on this project.
