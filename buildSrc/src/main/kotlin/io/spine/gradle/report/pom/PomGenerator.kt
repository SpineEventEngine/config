/**
 * Generates a `pom.xml` file that contains dependencies of the root project as
 * well as the dependencies of its subprojects.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```
 *      PomGenerator.applyTo(project)
 * ```
 *
 * The generated `pom.xml` is not usable for Maven build tasks and is merely a
 * description of project dependencies.
 *
 * Configures the `build` task to generate the `pom.xml` file under `docs/dependencies`.
 *
 * Note that the generated `pom.xml` includes the group ID, artifact ID and the version of the
 * project this script was applied to. In case you want to override the default values, do so in
 * the `ext` block like so:
 *
 * ```
 * ext {
 *     groupId = 'custom-group-id'
 *     artifactId = 'custom-artifact-id'
 *     version = 'custom-version'
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * By default, those values are taken from the `project` object, which may or may not include
 * them. If the project does not have these values, and they are not specified in the `ext`
 * block, the resulting `pom.xml` file is going to contain empty blocks,
 * e.g., `<groupId></groupId>`.
 *
 * The version reported for each dependency is the one selected by dependency
 * resolution. A task of one project must not resolve the configurations of
 * another, so `generatePom` does not resolve anything itself. Instead, a helper
 * task named [ResolvedVersions.taskName] is registered for the project passed
 * to [applyTo] and each of its subprojects. Every helper resolves only the
 * configurations of its own project and stores the result under its build
 * directory; `generatePom` depends on the helpers and merges their outputs.
 * This keeps the generated file the same no matter which other tasks run in
 * the same Gradle invocation.
