/**
 * Stores the versions selected by dependency resolution, per project.
 *
 * Gradle forbids resolving the configurations of one project from a task of
 * another: a task holds the lock of its own project only, and cross-project
 * resolution fails with `IllegalResolutionException`. So the `generatePom` task
 * of the root project cannot resolve the configurations of subprojects itself.
 * Instead, [a task][registerTaskIn] is registered for every project, resolving
 * only the configurations of its own project — which is always lock-safe — and
 * storing the result under the project's build directory. `generatePom` depends
 * on these tasks and [reads their outputs][readFrom].
 *
 * This makes the report independent of which other tasks run in the same Gradle
 * invocation. Reading `resolutionResult` from the root task directly worked only
 * when a previous task of the owning project had already resolved the configuration,
 * so the report differed between `gradle build` and `gradle generatePom`.
 *
 * @see PomGenerator

 * or Gradle's conflict resolution can all select another version. Reading the
 * resolution result captures the selected version, so the report describes the
 * dependencies actually on the classpath rather than the requested ones.
 *
 * Only resolvable configurations of this project contribute. When a module resolves
 * to different versions across configurations, the newest one (by [VersionComparator])
 * is kept, matching the deduplication applied by [DependencyWriter] afterwards.
 *
 * Reading a resolution graph is lenient: a module that cannot be resolved — be it
 * missing from the repositories, or a casualty of `failOnVersionConflict()` —
 * becomes an `UnresolvedDependencyResult` edge and simply contributes no version,
 * never an exception. So the report cannot break the build, and no failure needs
 * to be — or is — swallowed here: anything actually thrown is unexpected and
 * fails the collecting task loudly.
 *
 * Must be called either from a task of this very project, or before the task
 * execution starts — otherwise Gradle rejects the resolution as unsafe.
