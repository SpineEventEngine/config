/**
 * The experimental Google Cloud Artifact Registry repository.
 *
 * In order to successfully publish into this repository, a service account key is needed.
 * The publisher must create a service account, grant it the permission to write into
 * Artifact Registry, and generate a JSON key.
 * Then, the key must be placed somewhere on the file system and the environment variable
 * `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` must be set to point at the key file.
 * Once these preconditions are met, publishing becomes possible.
 *
 * Google provides a Gradle plugin for configuring the publishing repository credentials
 * automatically. We achieve the same goal by assembling the credentials manually. We do so
 * in order to fit the Google Cloud Artifact Registry repository into the standard frame of
 * the Maven [Repository]-s. Applying the plugin would take a substantial effort due to the fact
 * that both our publishing scripts and Google's plugin use `afterEvaluate { }` hooks.
 * Ordering said hooks is a non-trivial operation and the result is usually quite fragile.
 * Thus, we choose to do this small piece of configuration manually.
