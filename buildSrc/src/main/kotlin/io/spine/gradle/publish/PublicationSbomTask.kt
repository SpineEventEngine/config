/**
 * Writes the SBOM published with an artifact, naming the modules of this build by
 * the coordinates they are published under.
 *
 * The task rewrites the document that the SPDX Gradle Plugin writes for the dependencies
 * of the artifact — which all publications of a JVM module share — into the SBOM of
 * one [artifact][artifactCoordinates]:
 *
 *  - the document is named after the artifact, and given a namespace derived from its
 *    coordinates, in place of the placeholder the plugin leaves there;
 *  - each package describing a module of this build — the artifact itself, and each
 *    sibling module it depends on — declares the [license][LicenseSettings.spdxId] of
 *    the modules of this build, is named `group:artifactId`, and gets the version and
 *    the package URL of the published artifact. The package URL replaces the external
 *    references the plugin wrote, if any. The plugin lists such a module under the name
 *    of its Gradle project, with neither a license nor a package URL.
 *
 * A module of this build is recognized by the source information the plugin gives it,
 * which ends with the path of the Gradle project in brackets; no other package has it.
 * A sibling without a single Maven publication to name it after — typically a module
 * bundled into the artifact of another one, such as a fat JAR — has no coordinates of
 * its own: it only gets the license, and keeps the name of its project.
