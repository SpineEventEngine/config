/**
 * Publishes a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) with each artifact of this build.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```
 * PublicationSbom.registerTasks(project, projectsToPublish)
 * ```
 *
 * The SBOM is an SPDX 2.3 document, written by the
 * [SPDX Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-gradle-plugin) and completed by
 * [PublicationSbomTask]. It lists what an artifact depends on at runtime — never the
 * build tooling, nor the libraries used only to test it. Being published next to the
 * artifact, as `<artifactId>-<version>.spdx.json`, it enters the manifest of
 * [PublicationChecksums], so the provenance attestation covers it too.
 *
 * ## One SBOM per published artifact
 *
 * Each publication gets an SBOM of its own, named after the artifact it publishes. The
 * publications of a JVM module describe the same dependencies — its `runtimeClasspath`.
 * A Kotlin Multiplatform module publishes an artifact per target, so the SBOM of each
 * target publication describes the dependencies of that target — except for an Android
 * target compiled per build variant, which gets none yet, with a warning. The
 * `kotlinMultiplatform` umbrella publication has no runtime of its own, and gets none.
 * A Kotlin/Native compilation has no runtime configuration either: its klibs are linked
 * into the binary of the consumer, so the SBOM of a Native target describes the
 * dependencies of its compilation instead.
 *
 * The Gradle Plugin Portal does not receive the SBOM: its upload skips files other than
 * JARs, so the SBOM of a Gradle plugin is published to the Maven repositories only.
 * A plugin marker publication consists of a POM alone, and gets no SBOM.
 *
 * ## Naming the modules of this build
 *
 * The plugin lists a module of this build under the name of its Gradle project, with
 * neither a license nor a package URL — `client` rather than `io.spine:spine-client`.
 * [PublicationSbomTask] renames it after the publication of the module. The coordinates
 * are collected once all projects are evaluated, when the publications no longer change,
 * and handed to the tasks as plain values — so that no task reads the state of another
 * project while it runs.
