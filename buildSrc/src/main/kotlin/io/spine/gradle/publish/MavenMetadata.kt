 * element is mapped, and unknown elements are ignored.
 *
 * @property versioning The `<versioning>` element holding the list of published versions.
 *   It is `var` with a default value purely to support deserialization: `buildSrc` uses a
 *   plain [XmlMapper] without the Kotlin module, so Jackson instantiates this class through
 *   the synthesized no-arg constructor and then assigns the property through its setter. The
 *   mutability is required by Jackson, not used by our own code; a `val` would silently
 *   leave the version list empty.
