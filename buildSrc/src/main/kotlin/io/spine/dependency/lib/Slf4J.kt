/**
 * Spine used to log with SLF4J. Now we use Flogger. Whenever a choice comes up, we recommend
 * using the latter.
 *
 * The primary purpose of having this dependency object is working in combination with
 * [Flogger.Runtime.slf4JBackend].
 *
 * Some third-party libraries may clash with different versions of the library.
 * Thus, we specify this version and force it via [forceVersions].
 * Please see `DependencyResolution.kt` for details.
