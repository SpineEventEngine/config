/**
 * Jackson library dependencies.
 *
 * Jackson 3.x uses the `tools.jackson` group ID and the matching `tools.jackson.*`
 * packages ([JSTEP-1](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-future-ideas/wiki/JSTEP-1)).
 * The sole exception is `jackson-annotations`: Jackson 3.x keeps
 * consuming the 2.x artifact, so both its coordinates and its
 * `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation` package stay unchanged.
 *
 * The Jackson 2.x artifacts, which some of our dependencies still consume,
 * are declared by [JacksonV2].
 *
 * See:
 *  - [Jackson Releases](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Releases)
 *  - [Migrating to Jackson 3](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/blob/main/jackson3/MIGRATING_TO_JACKSON_3.md)
