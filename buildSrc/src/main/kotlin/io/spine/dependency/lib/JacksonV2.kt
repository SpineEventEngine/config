/**
 * Jackson 2.x dependencies.
 *
 * Jackson 2.x artifacts keep the `com.fasterxml.jackson.*` group IDs, unlike
 * Jackson 3.x, which moved to `tools.jackson`
 * ([JSTEP-1](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-future-ideas/wiki/JSTEP-1)).
 *
 * We declare the 2.x line to align the versions of the artifacts pulled transitively by third-party
 * dependencies, while our own code uses Jackson 3.x declared by [Jackson].
 *
 * The `jackson-annotations` artifact, although it belongs to the 2.x line, is
 * declared by [Jackson.annotations] because Jackson 3.x keeps consuming it.
 *
 * See:
 *  - [Jackson Releases](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Releases)
 *
 * @see Jackson
