 * The FindBugs project has been dead since 2017. It has a successor called SpotBugs,
 * but we don't use it. We use ErrorProne for static analysis instead.
 * The only reason for having this dependency is the annotations for null-checking
 * introduced by JSR-305. These annotations are troublesome,
 * but no alternatives are known for some of them so far.
 * Please see [this issue](https://github.com/SpineEventEngine/base/issues/108) for more details.
