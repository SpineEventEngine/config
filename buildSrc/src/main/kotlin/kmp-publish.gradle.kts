/**
 * Configures publications for `kmp-module`.
 *
 * As for now, [spinePublishing][io.spine.gradle.publish.spinePublishing]
 * doesn't support Kotlin Multiplatform modules. So, their publications are
 * configured by this script plugin. Other publishing-related configuration
 * is still performed by the extension.
 *
 * To publish a KMP module, one still needs to open and configure
 * `spinePublishing` extension. Make sure `spinePublishing.customPublishing`
 * property is set to `true`, and this script plugin is applied.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * plugins {
 *     `kmp-module`
 *     `kmp-publish`
 * }
 *
 * spinePublishing {
 *     destinations = setOf(...)
 *     customPublishing = true
 * }
 * ```
