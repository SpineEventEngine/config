# CLAUDE.md — Project Conventions

## Project Guidelines

- Quick-reference baseline: `.agents/quick-reference-card.md` — always read this first.
- For specific tasks (code review, PR prep, dependency updates, docs, etc.): prefer the matching
  skill from `.agents/skills/`.
- Full standards reference: `.agents/_TOC.md` — consult when a skill
  doesn't cover the needed context.

## Workflow Rules

- Use Plan mode (`EnterPlanMode`) for architecture, refactoring, multi-file changes, or lengthy documentation.
- Write the plan to `.agents/tasks/<slug>.md` before coding. See `.agents/tasks/README.md` for format and lifecycle.
- If something goes wrong — STOP and re-plan immediately.
- One focused task per subagent.
- **Never `git commit`, `git push`, `git tag`, or otherwise rewrite git history** unless
  the active skill's `SKILL.md` has a `## Commit authorization` section, or the *current* user
  prompt explicitly tells you to. Authorization does not carry over between turns.
  See `.agents/safety-rules.md` → *Commits and history-writing*.

## Memory

Two stores, split by audience:

- **Team-shared memory** lives in `.agents/memory/` (checked into git). Use it
  for feedback rules, durable project rationale, and external system pointers.
  See `.agents/memory/README.md` for layout and write protocol.
- **Per-developer memory** lives in the built-in auto-memory dir. Use it for
  personal preferences, ephemeral project state, and per-machine resources.

Litmus test: *would a teammate benefit from this next month?* → repo.
Otherwise → auto-memory.

Review `.agents/memory/MEMORY.md` at the start of every session.
Ruthlessly iterate until mistakes stop repeating.

## Verification & Quality

- Never mark a task done without proof (tests, logs, diff vs main).
- Ask: "Would a senior/staff engineer approve this?"
- For non-trivial changes: pause and consider a more elegant solution.
- Fix bugs autonomously — find root cause, no hand-holding, no band-aids.

## Core Principles

- Simplicity first: minimal code impact, minimal surface area.
- No laziness: always find root causes.
- Minimal side effects: avoid new bugs.
- Prefer early returns and clear naming.
- Challenge your own work before presenting it.

## Task Flow

1. Draft plan → `.agents/tasks/<slug>.md` (see README there).
2. Show plan (`ExitPlanMode`) before implementing.
3. Execute + track progress (file at checkpoints, `TaskCreate` for live status).
4. Verify + summarize changes.
5. Update memory if lessons emerged.
6. Delete the task file on merge to master.

## Final Rule

This is living team memory. Update it regularly and keep it concise
(<120 lines / ~2.5k tokens).
